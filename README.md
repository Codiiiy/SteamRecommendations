# Steam Game Recommendation System

A Python-based recommendation engine built to practice data science and machine learning concepts using real-world Steam gaming data.

## Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with:


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **SQLite**: Local database for caching and analysis
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and text processing
- **VADER Sentiment**: Natural language processing for review analysis
- **Steam Web API**: External data source


## Key Learning Areas Practiced

- **API Integration**: Handling HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and API rate limiting
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations, joins, data integrity, and performance optimization  
- **Machine Learning**: Feature engineering, similarity calculations, and recommendation algorithms
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines, data cleaning, and statistical analysis
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling and data validation

*Built as a practical exercise in applying data science concepts to real-world gaming data.*
